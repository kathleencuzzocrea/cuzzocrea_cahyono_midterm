        <h1>Console VS. PC</h1>

        <img src="images/versus.png">

        <p>In the gaming world, one of the most frequently debated topics is that of consoles versus PCs. The machine on which someone chooses to play a video game is something that many gamers feel very strongly about because there are many pros and cons to both sides.</p>

        <h2>Why console is better:</h2>

        <p>I personally prefer playing games on a console and believe that consoles are superior to PCs for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Convenience</li>
            <li>Affordability</li>
            <li>Access to physical games</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Convenience</h3>

        <p>Consoles provide a much simpler user experience than PCs because they are focused primarily on gaming, compared to PCs which are focused on all types of computing. On a console, your owned games are immediately available to you from the system startup, compared to on PC where most games are housed on apps like Steam or EA. Game publishers are starting to follow Steam’s footsteps and release their own launcher apps for their own games which can make it even more confusing for users when the games they have bought aren’t all accessible from the same space.</p>

        <p>Consoles are also much more user friendly because they don’t require extensive knowledge of the machine’s hardware much like a PC would. Most of the time, the only thing a console gamer has to concern themself with is storage and resolution, where a PC gamer in order to maximize their gaming experience would require knowledge of their system’s processors, RAM, GHz, HDDs/SSDs, Graphics cards, and the list goes on, especially if they built their PC themself which is in itself a massive commitment of time and money. With consoles you can simply take it out of the box, plug it in, and start playing.</p>

        <h3>Affordability</h3>

        <p>Console gaming is also a significantly less expensive investment compared to PC. A top-of-the-line console in 2025 like a Playstation 5 or Xbox Series X brand new and at its most expensive would cost somewhere from $700-$800, which includes a controller and everything that you would need in order to use the system. Meanwhile, for the same amount of money, you would only be able to buy a decent PC with slightly worse specs, not including the additional cost of necessary peripherals like a monitor, mouse, and keyboard. </p>

        <h3>Access to physical games</h3>
        <p>Another important aspect of console gaming that the PC completely neglects is physical games. As technology advances and games become increasingly larger in terms of file sizes, it has become more common for them to only be released digitally, especially for smaller indie games. When only owning a game digitally though, you lose the ability to fully own your own copy of a game and control when you update it. It’s also not possible to re-sell or share a game you finished playing with a friend if the game only exists in a digital space. In the past, digital copies of games also used to take up more system storage than physical ones because with physical copies, part of the game itself was stored on the disc or cartridge. PC gaming completely removes the option to buy your games physically which can be a very important thing to many gamers.</p>
